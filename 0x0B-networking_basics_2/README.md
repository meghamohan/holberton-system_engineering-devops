# Networking basics
- Localhost- It just means this computer. It is used to access the network services that are running on the host via its loopback network interface. The loopback mechanism is useful for testing software during development, independently of any network configs. In most computer systems, localhost resolves to the IP address 127.0.0.1 which is the most commonly used IPv4 loopback address.
- Loopback- Loopback, or loop-back, refers to the routing of electronic signals, digital data streams, or flows of items back to their source without intentional processing or modification. This is primarily a means of testing the transmission or transportation infrastructure.
- 0.0.0.0- non-routable meta-address used to designate an invalid, unknown or non-applicable target. In the context of servers, 0.0.0.0 means "all IPv4 addresses on the local machine". If a host has two IP addresses, 192.168.1.1 and 10.1.2.1, and a server running on the host listens on 0.0.0.0, it will be reachable at both of those IPs. In the context of routing, 0.0.0.0 usually means the default route, i.e. the route which leads to "the rest of" the internet instead of somewhere on the local network.
- Host Files- plain text file that all operating systems use to translate hostnames into IP addresses. Whenever you type in a hostname, such as facebook.com, your system will look into the hosts file to get the IP address that it needs to connect to the appropriate server. However, if you open the hosts file, you’ll quickly notice that it doesn’t have the directory of the entire Internet in there. Instead, there might be just a couple lines and that’s it. Your system will always check the hosts file first, and anything that isn’t defined in the hosts file will be looked up on the DNS servers defined in your network settings (usually your ISP’s DNS servers).
If you ask for facebook.com, the DNS servers will return Facebook’s IP address to your computer. But if you wanted to block Facebook on that computer, you can add an entry in the hosts file that tells your computer that facebook.com points to some other IP address that’s different from Facebook’s actual IP address. To block Facebook, you could say in the hosts file that facebook.com should point to 127.0.0.1, which is the loopback IP address that will always point back to your own system. 
- Editing hostfiles- On Linux, you can find the hosts file under /etc/hosts.
